Before we install our theme, you might want to [download the theme project]({{rootPrefix}}/assets/contents/fluorite-theme-plain-1.3.0.zip) and check the files against yours for any inconsistencies.

For the installation, we can either `cd` into the parent directory of `fluorite-theme-plain` and use the CLI command `fl theme add plain` or install the theme from within the theme directory using `fl theme add . --as plain`.

That's all we need to do for the installation. In the [next section]({{versionRootPrefix}}/themes/creating-a-new-theme/using-the-theme) we'll scaffold a new documentation project and use our theme.
