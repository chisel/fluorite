## First Usage

The following instructions help you learn Fluorite on your first usage:

  1. Run `fl new docs` to create a new project called `docs`
  2. Navigate to project root by running `cd docs`
  3. Run `fl serve` to build and serve the documentation
  4. Take a look at the generated documentation at `http://localhost:6001`
  5. Examine `docs/flconfig.json` and `docs/src` to see what generated the HTML you're viewing
  6. Read the [project structure]({{versionRootPrefix}}/project-structure) and [configuration]({{versionRootPrefix}}/configuration) to fully understand the project you've just made
