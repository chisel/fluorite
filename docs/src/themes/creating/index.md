Since Fluorite themes are mainly responsible for how the final documentation looks, we're going to create one in order to fully master the theme creation process. Our theme will have the following features:
  - Responsive design using Bootstrap
  - Comes in light and dark flavors
  - Accepts responsive markdown through comment parsing

After finishing this guide, we will end up with the following theme:

<!-- responsive: desktop -->
![Fluorite Plain Theme]({{rootPrefix}}/assets/contents/fluorite-plain-theme-desktop.png)
<!-- /responsive -->
<!-- responsive: tablet -->
![Fluorite Plain Theme]({{rootPrefix}}/assets/contents/fluorite-plain-theme-tablet.png)
<!-- /responsive -->
<!-- responsive: mobile -->
![Fluorite Plain Theme]({{rootPrefix}}/assets/contents/fluorite-plain-theme-mobile.png)
<!-- /responsive -->

The [next section]({{versionRootPrefix}}/themes/creating-a-new-theme/setting-up-the-theme) will cover the setup process.
