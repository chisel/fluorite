Markdown files can be used to document anything other than REST APIs. You can bundle multiple Markdown files with REST API JSON files to form a section of the documentation. Fluorite supports the Github flavor of Markdown with all the extended features (tables, strikethrough, etc.)

A full example of a Markdown file is available at [Markdown Example]({{versionRootPrefix}}/contents/markdown-example).
