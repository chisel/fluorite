If you have created your own theme or are using a theme created by the community, you can install the theme in one of the following ways:

  - `cd` into the parent directory of the theme and run `fl theme add theme-name` (replace `theme-name` with the actual theme name)
  - `cd` into the theme directory and run `fl theme add . --as theme-name`
  - Manually copy the theme directory to `fluorite-root/themes/theme-name`

> Theme directories are prefixed with `fluorite-theme-` but you don't have to include that in the commands.
